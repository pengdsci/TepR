#  01: OPEN R GRAPHIC WINDOWS
#      Following commands open R graphic windows:

       windows()              # open an active graphic window
       X11()                  # open another active graphic window and turn 
                              # all previously graphic windows inactive!
       plot.new()             # erase all graphs in the currently active window for new graphics
       dev.set()              # switch status of activity among opened graphic windows sequentially
       dev.off()              # shut downs the open graphic windows sequentially.

#  02: CONTROLLING LAYOUT OF THE GRAPHIC WINDOWS 
#      The par() function for querying and setting plotting parameters.
       help(par)
#
#      Some important parameters to set:
          par(pin=c(5, 4),          #   plot width and height in inches
              mfrow=c(3,4),         #   3x4 layout of 12 plots, filling rows first (mfcol)
              mgp=c(1, 0, 0),       #   distance of axis title ("x","y"),
                                    #   numbers at the ticks, border line,
                                    #   (in margin lines)
              mar=c(1,2,3,4),       #   margins: bottom-left-top-right (in lines)
              oma=c(1,1,1,1),       #   outer margin around the collection
                                    #   of plots on the page (in lines)
              mex=0.8,              #   expansion of margin line width,
                                    #   relative to default
              cex=0.8)              #   expansion of characters, relative to default
#
#      The rest of parameters of par() can be found in the help doc in R by typing ?par.
#      You can use these parameters to design a fancy graphic page!
#
#  03: PLOTTING FUNCTION plot():
#      The basic parameters in plot() are given below
#    
#     plot(x.coordinate, y.coordinate,
#          type = ...  ,   #  "l" = line, "s"=step function (horizontal first)
#                          #  "S" = step function (vertical first), "h"=high density (needle) plot
#                          #  "p" = points, "b" = both points and lines, "o" = over-plotting of points and lines
#          lty = ...   ,   #  line types such as 0 = "blank", 1 = "solid", 2 = "dashed", 3 = "dotted", 
#                          #  4 ="dotdash", 5 = "longdash" or 6 ="twodash", etc.
#          lwd = ...   ,   #  width of the line, using code 1 ,2 ,3 ....
#          pch = ...   ,   #  point types / characters, coding 1-25. See the following example.
#          col = ...   ,   #  color code, there are hundreds of different colors in R. More detail to follow.
#          ylim = ...  ,   #  scale interval limits of y-axis, 
#          xlim = ...  ,   #  scale interval limits of x-axis, 
#          xlab = ...  ,   #  Label of x-axis
#          ylab = ...  ,   #  Label of y-axis
#          main = ...  ,   #  overall title of the plot
#          cex = ...   ,   #  font size of the text on the plot.
#          ...             #  and many more......
#          )
#
#
#      Example: List of all possible point types in R:

       windows(width=10, height=3)    # the arguments specify the layout (size) of the graphic window
       plot(1:25, rep(1,25), pch=1:25, col=1:24, xlab="", ylab=" ", yaxt="n", cex=2)
                                      # yaxt="n" suppresses y axis, xaxt = "n" suppresses x-axis, 
                                      # axes=FALSE suppresses both axes

#  03: EDITING THE DEFAULT PLOT WITH LOWER LEVEL PLOTTING COMMANDS 
#
#      We illustrate these commands using following example:

       x = seq(0, 2 * pi, length = 15)
       y = sin(x)
       plot(x, y, axes = FALSE, type = "b", pch = "*", xlab = NA, ylab = NA)

#      A). DRAWING AXES
# 
         axis(side = 1,                     # 1 = x-axis (below the grap, 2 = y-axis (left), 3 = above, 4 = right
              at = c(0,1,2,pi,4,5,2*pi),    # the location of the points at which tick-marks are to be drawn. 
              labels = expression(0,1,2,pi,4,5,2*pi),  # scale at the tick marks defined above
              pos=0,                        # position of the axis, in this case. x-axis is defined to be y = 0
              lty= 1,                       # line types for both axis and tick marks
              lwd = 1,                      # line width for both axis and tick marks 
              col = 2:3,                    # colors for axis and tick marks respectively
              font.axis = 4                 # Fonts can be one of 1, 2, 3 or 4 for normal, bold, italic and bold-italic.
             )

          axis(side = 2, 
              at = c(-1, -0.5, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
              col=3:4,    # color for axis labels
              col.axis = 2,  
              pos = 0,    # y-axis is x = 0,
              las = 1,    #  orientation of axis-lables: 0 = parallel, 1 = horizontal, 2 = right angle to the axis, 3 - vertical
              )

#      B). PLOT ANNOTATION  
#          The function title can be used to place labels in the margins of a plot.
#
#          title(main=str, sub=str, xlab=str, ylab=str)
#
#          The arguments are as follows:
#          main : a main title to appear above the graph,
#          sub : a subtitle to appear below the graph,
#          xlab : a label for the x axis,
#          ylab : a label for the y axis.

           title( main = "Sine Curve",
                  font.main = 3 ,            # choosen from 1-4
                  col.main = "red"  ,
                  cex=1.2  ,
                  sub = "add subtitles here ....",   # you can use font.sub, col.sub, cex.sub options
                  xlab = "x coordinates",            # you can use font.lab, col.lab, cex.lab options
                  ylab = "y coordinates"

                )
#
#        C). FRAMING
#          It can be useful to draw a box around a plot. This can be done with the function box. The call

           box()

#          draws a box around the plot region (the region within the plot margins). The call

           box("figure", col = "blue")

#          draws a box around the figure region (the region containing the plot and its margins).
#          An optional col argument makes it possible to specify the colour for the box.
#
#       D). DRAWING POINTS
#           The basic call has the form:
#
#           points(x, y, pch=22, col= 3)
#
#          where:
#          1). pch specifies the plotting symbol. Values 1 to 25 are  special graphical symbols, 
#              values from 33 to 126 are taken to ASCII codes. A quoted character will also work,
#          2). col gives a colour specification. Examples are, "red", "lightblue", etc.
#          
#      E). DRAWING CONNECTED LINE SEGMENTS
#          The basic call has the form:

           lines(x, y, lty=2,  lwd=2, col="red")
           lines(x, y, type="s", lty=2, lwd=1, col="blue")
           lines(x, y, type="S", lty=3, lwd=2, col=6)

#          where:
#          1).  lty specifies the line texture. It should be one of "blank", "solid", "dashed", 
#               "dotted", "dotdash", "longdash" or "twodash".
#          2).  Alternatively the length of on/off pen stokes in the texture. "11" is a high density 
#               dotted line, "33" is a short dashed line and "1333" is a dot-dashed line.
#          3).  lwd and col specify the line width and colour.
#
#       F). DRAWING STRAIGHT LINES
#           The basic call has the forms:

            abline(a=0, b=1, lty=3, lwd=3, col="green")
            abline(h=c(-0.25,0.25), col="pink")
            abline(v=c(2,4,5), col="blue")

#           where
#           1). The a / b form specifies a line in intercept / slope form.
#           2). h specifies horizontal lines at the given y values.
#           3). v specifies vertical lines at the given x values.
#           4). Line texture, colour and width arguments can also be given.
#
#       G). DRAWING DISCONNECTED LINE SEGMENTS
#           The basic call has the form:
#
#              segments(x0, y0, x1, y1)
#
#           where
#           1). The x0, y0, x1, y1 arguments give the start and end coordinates of the segments.
#           2). Line texture, colour and width arguments can also be given
#
#           Example 1: Consider a figure which is created by taking a series of
#           equally spaced points around the circumference of a circle
#           and joining each of these points to all the other points.
#
             n = 17                                              # n = number of equal spaced vertices on the circle
             theta = seq(0, 2 * pi, length = n + 1)[1:n]         # theta[1] = 0, theta[n+1] = 2*pi, sin(0) = sin(2*pi) 
             x = sin(theta)                                      # x-coordinates of the vertices
             y = cos(theta)                                      # y-coordinates of the vertices
             plot.new()
             plot.window(xlim = c(-1, 1), ylim = c(-1, 1), asp = 1)
             for (i in 1:n){
                for (j in i:n){
                     col.num= 2 + j%%4                             # Use only 
                     # cat("Color code =", col.num,"\n ")
                     segments(x[i], y[i], x[j], y[j], col=col.num)
                     Sys.sleep(0.5)
                   }
                }
#
#            You can change the number of vertices and the number of colors used in the graphic to get visual effects.
#
#            Example 2: Here is another example which shows how the eye can
#            perceive a sequence of straight lines as a curve.

              n=58
              x1 = seq(0, 1, length = n)
              y1 = rep(0, n)
              x2 = rep(0, n)
              y2 = seq(1, 0, length = n)
              plot.new()
              plot.window(xlim = c(0, 1),ylim = c(0, 1), asp = 1)
              #  segments(x1, y1, x2, y2)                 # this command draws all line segment at once. We can add colors to it
              for(i in 1:n){
                  col.num=2+i%%4
                  segments(x1[i], y1[i], x2[i], y2[i], col=col.num) 
                 }
              box(col = "grey")

#           Example 3. Moving tangent lines on a sine curve:
#
             sine.tan.line = function(tt,d) {
                   x=seq(-pi,pi,pi/18)
                   y=sin(x)
                   n=length(x)
                   plot(0,0, xlim=c(-pi,pi), ylim=c(-1.1,1.1), xlab="",ylab="")

#
#       H). DRAWING ARROWS
#           The basic call has the form:
#
#           arrows(x0, y0, x1, y1, code=int, length=num, angle=num)
#
#           where
#           1). The x0, y0, x1, y1 arguments give the start and end coordinates of the arrows.
#           2). code=1 – head at the start, code=2 – head at the end and code=3 – a head at both ends.
#           3). length and angle – length of the arrow head and angle to the shaft.
#           Example

            plot.new()
            plot.window(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1))
            arrows(.05, .075, .45, .9, code = 1, angle=60,col=2, length = 0.5)
            arrows(.55, .9, .95, .075, code = 2, angle=30,col=3, length = 0.25)
            arrows(.1, 0, .9, 0, code = 3, angle=10,col=4,     length = 0.125)

            text(1, 0, "C", cex = 0.5, col=4)

#
#      I). DRAWING RECTANGLES
#          The basic call has the form:

#          rect(x0, y0, x1, y1, col=str, border=str)

#          where
#          1). x0, y0, x1, y1 give the coordinates of diagonally opposite corners of the rectangles.
#          2). col and border specify the colour of the interior and border of the rectangles.
#          3). line texture and width specifications can also be given.
#          Example: The following code illustrates how a barplot or histogram could be constructed.

           plot.new()
           plot.window(xlim = c(0, 5), ylim = c(0, 10))
           rect(0:4, 0, 1:5, c(7, 8, 4, 3), col = 2:6)
           axis(1)
           axis(2, las = 1)

#
#      J). DRAWING POLYGONS
#          The basic call has the form:

#          polygon(x, y, col=str, border=str)

#          where
#          1).  x and y give the coordinates of the polygon vertexes. NA values separate polygons.
#          2).  col and border specify the colour of the interior and border of the polygons.
#          3).  line texture and width specifications can also be given.
#          A simple example: 

            x = c(0.32, 0.62, 0.88, 0.89, 0.59, 0.29)
            y = c(0.83, 0.61, 0.66, 0.18, 0.36, 0.14)
            plot.new()
            plot.window(xlim = range(x), ylim = range(y))
            polygon(x, y, col = "green")
            box()

#          A fancy example: Spiral squares
#       
           plot.new()
           plot.window(xlim = c(-1, 1), ylim = c(-1, 1), asp = 1)
           x = c(-1, 1, 1, -1)
           y = c( 1, 1, -1, -1)  
           polygon(x, y, col="beige")   # This is actually the unit sqaure!

           vertex1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
           vertex2 = c(2, 3, 4, 1)

           for(i in 1:50) {
               x = 0.9 * x[vertex1] + 0.1 * x[vertex2]
               y = 0.9 * y[vertex1] + 0.1 * y[vertex2]
               polygon(x, y, col="beige") 
               Sys.sleep(1)
             }
#
#      K). DRAWING TEXT
#          The basic call has the form:
#
#          text(x, y, labels)
#
#          where
#          1). x and y give the text coordinates.
#          2). labels gives the actual text strings. Optionally,
#          3). font and col give the font and colour of the text,
#          4). srt and adj give the rotation and justification of the strings.
#          An Example:

           plot.new()
           plot.window(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1))
           abline(h = c(.2, .5, .8), v = c(.5, .2, .8), col = "lightgrey")
           text(0.5, 0.5, "srt = 45, adj = c(.5, .5)", srt=45, adj=c(.5, .5))
           text(0.5, 0.8, "adj = c(0, .5)", adj = c(0, .5))
           text(0.5, 0.2, "adj = c(1, .5)", adj = c(1, .5))
           text(0.2, 0.5, "adj = c(1, 1)", adj = c(1, 1))
           text(0.8, 0.5, "adj = c(0, 0)", adj = c(0, 0))
           axis(1); axis(2, las = 1); box()
#
#
#      L). DRAWING LEGEND
#          A simple example has the form:
#
#          legend(xloc, yloc, 
#                legend=text,
#                lty=linetypes, 
#                lwd=linewidths,
#                pch=glyphname, 
#                col=colours,
#                xjust=justification, 
#                yjust=justification
#              )
#
#          where
#           1). xloc and yloc give the coordinates where the legend is to be placed;
#           2). xjust and yjust give the justification of the legend box with respect to the location. 
#           3). The other values describe the legend contents.
#
#           The legend function is very flexible. Consult its manual entry for details.
#
#            Example
#
              xe = seq(-3, 3, length = 1001)
              ye = dnorm(xe)
              xa = seq(-3, 3, length = 201)
              ya = dnorm(xa) + rnorm(201, sd = .01)
              ylim = range(ye, ya)
              plot.new()
              plot.window(xlim = c(-3, 3), ylim = ylim)    #  layout of the graphic
              lines(xe, ye, lty = "11", lwd = 2, col=2)           #
              lines(xa, ya, lty = "solid", lwd = 1, col=3)        #
              legend(3, max(ylim),
                    legend = c("Exact", "Approximate"),
                    lty = c("11", "solid"),
                    lwd = c(2, 1),
                    col = c(2,3),
                    xjust = 1, 
                    yjust = 1, 
                    bty = "n"                              # no box on the legend text
                   )
              axis(1)                                      # add x-axis 
              axis(2, las = 1)                             # add y-axis, label is horizontal
              box()                                        # add a box to the graphic
#
#
#      M). MULTIFIGURE LAYOUTS
#          par() can be used to set up arrays of figures on the page. These
#          arrays are then filled row-by-row or column-by-column.
#          The following example declares a two-by-two array to be filled by rows and then produces the plots.

           par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
           plot(rnorm(10), type = "p")
           plot(rnorm(10), type = "l")
           plot(rnorm(10), type = "b")
           plot(rnorm(10), type = "o")

#          A two-by-two array to be filled by columns would be declared with

           par(mfcol = c(2, 2))

#
#      N). ELIMINATING WASTE MARGIN SPACE
#          It can be useful to eliminate redundant space from multi-way
#          arrays by trimming the margins a little.

           par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
           par(mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 0.1, 2.1))
           par(oma = c(0, 0, 4, 0))
           plot(rnorm(10), type = "p")
           plot(rnorm(10), type = "l")
           plot(rnorm(10), type = "b")
           plot(rnorm(10), type = "o")
           title(main = "Plots with Margins Trimmed", outer = TRUE)  # "outer = TRUE" claims the over title. 
#
#         Here we have trimmed space from the top of each plot, and
#         placed a 4 line outer margin at the top of of the layout.
